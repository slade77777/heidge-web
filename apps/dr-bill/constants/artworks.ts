            OP artists like Victor Vasarely and Bridget Riley, graphic artists
            like M.C. Escher, as well as a few painters like Picasso and Warhol.
            Many of these artists lived and worked before the advent of
            Generative Art and did not use computers. However, when I look at
            their efforts, I attempt to conceive an algorithm to create a

            `An oblique cube is a form of axonometric (parallel) projection where the front face is full size and shape (height and width), perpendicular to the viewer and the depth is drawn full size along receding lines, usually a 45-degree angle.`,
            `In this composition an array of squares is generated. Within each square, oblique cubes are drawn in pieces from back to front, in a random orientation, in random colors. All the cube faces are the same random color. A random number "coin flip" algorithm determines whether or not a diamond shape is drawn on the front face of the cube. All the diamond shapes on the cube faces are the same random color.`,
            `What makes this image interesting to me is the way the faces of contiguous cubes combine and how the areas of the square that the cube does not cover (the black background) integrate into the piece and provide structure producing a visual "whole greater than the sum of its parts.`,
